ShrimpOS

Basically PrawnOS but with _flashy_ new things including
- Panfrost
- Boot splash
- WebGL
- Testing Debian repositories
- Blobs to make internal WiFi work
- Newer kernel


Coming Soon™:
- Box86 emulator by @ptitSeb
- Wine from TwisterOS
- Hardware accelerated VAAPI(if i can figure it out)
- Xonotic
- XNA games


Currently only tested on armhf hardware, but if anyone donates a aarch64/arm64 laptop I will include support for it.
